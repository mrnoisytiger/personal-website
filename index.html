<!-- About Me Text -->
<div id="about">
    <p>Felix Jen is one of the extremely talented young pianists and he made his first public debut at the age of eleven with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, conducted by renown conductor, Jeffery Kahane at the Alex Theatre. He started his piano lessons at the age of six. Under very disciplined training, he has actively performed on the stage, with over seventy recitals and events throughout his high school years. He became a featured pianist in many events including a KPFK 90.7FM live radio broadcast — Halfway Down the Stairs, Recital Tribute to KUSC 91.5FM, Colburn Honor recitals, the L.A. Music Center Blue Ribbon Event, Pasadena Friends of Colburn, and many other charity events. Additionally, Felix has been a chamber pianist in the Ed & Marie Chamber Orchestra.</p>
    
    <p> Under three years of instruction from Profesor Jeff Lavner, Felix played his solo piano concert at the age of sixteen, with repertoire from Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Stravinsky … to Liszt. His brilliant and amazing technical skill is well acknowledged, as a true talent, and his youthful energy builds up his personal style. He has won many competitions and awards including the SYMF Open Chopin Etude award, SYMF Open Chopin Scherzo, … With all his achievements, he has been awarded full scholarships from the Rose Hill Foundation for music, the prestigious Richard D. Colburn full scholarship, as well as Merit Scholarship from The Colburn School. He has studied from Jeff Lavner, Ory Shihor, and has taken masterclasses with many other professors, including Dr. Stewart Gordon and Dr. Milton Stern, and has taken lessons with Daniel Pollack, and Robert Thies. Felix is also very passionate about community service, participating in Colburn’s community outreach program, Musical Encounter, which introduces 4th and 5th grade students in underserved Los Angeles neighborhoods to the performing arts.</p>

    <p>Here, Felix Jen would like to give special thanks to Robert McAllister, Jeff Lavner, Ory Shihor, and many other teachers who have given him lessons and support. Music is part of his life forever.</p>
